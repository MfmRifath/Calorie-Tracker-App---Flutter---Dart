# calorie_tracker_app

A calorie tracker app is a digital tool designed to help users monitor their daily caloric intake and expenditure. The app typically allows users to log their meals, snacks, and beverages by searching for foods in a comprehensive database or by manually entering nutritional information. It provides detailed insights into the nutritional value of the consumed foods, including calories, macronutrients (carbohydrates, proteins, fats), and micronutrients (vitamins, minerals).
